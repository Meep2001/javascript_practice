/*
    SESSION STORAGE

    The sessionStorage object is used much less often than localStorage.

    Properties and methods are the same, but itâ€™s much more limited:

    The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.
    Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
    But it is shared between iframes in the same tab 
    (assuming they come from the same origin).
    The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

sessionStorage.setItem('name',1);
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('name'));
